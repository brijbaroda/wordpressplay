BotDetect Captcha plugin is a powerful captcha protection for WordPress login, lost password, registration, and comment forms.

== Description ==

BotDetect Captcha plugin is a powerful captcha protection for WordPress login, lost password, registration, and comment forms.

BotDetect is unique among Captcha solutions in offering many Captcha image and sound styles. While each of them is easily comprehensible to human users, randomly using multiple Captcha styles makes the Captcha challenge practically impossible to pass automatically.

BotDetect Captcha is ADA and Section 508 compliant and provides an audio Captcha alternative to keep your forms accessible to the blind and other people for whom reading the Captcha code could be a problem.

Features:

* 60 secure & readable Captcha image styles
* 10 secure & accessible audio Captcha sound styles
* Localized Captcha generation, using various Unicode character sets and downloadable multi-language sound pronunciations
* Custom Captcha image size, color scheme, complexity (code length), support for filtering out offensive words, tabindex control, customizing CSS, and many other captcha customization options
* Produces XHTML 1.1 Strict and WCAG AAA compliant markup
* Validates properly when CAPTCHA forms are simultaneously open in multiple browser tabs
* Tested in IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera browsers released since 2001.
* Full support for all Android & iOS devices
